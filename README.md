 AutoHot Key Mappings for using Apple Wireless Keyboard on PC - Works on 64bit windows/AHK

I couldn't get any of the existing mappings working, seems the primary issue was 64 bit vs 32 bit DLL calls in the scripts.
This is a very bare bones mapping, does what I need, and nothing else.
Tested on 64 bit Win10 with AHK 112207

Fn-Delete = delete
Fn <- = Home
Fn -> = End
Fn Up = Page Up
Fn Down = Page Down

Should be straight forwards to add more extensive remappings.
